Welcome to the home page of Ali Ncibi! I'm a human software developer with background in IT and CS (see Curriculum Vitae). I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science at the STIC Doctoral School University of Paris-Saclay, France. My research interests include Machine Learning (ML) and Internet of Things (IoT). It revolves around the development and evaluation of data-driven solutions for the task of human activity recognition using non-intrusive indoor sensors (see Thesis).
