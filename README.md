Greetings! I'm Ali, a data scientist who possesses a profound ardor for machine learning and a data-centric, analytical perspective. Presently, I'm pursuing a doctoral degree, and my research interests are inclined towards utilizing machine learning algorithms for inferring everyday human behavior through non-invasive sensorial data modeling. Moreover, I'm captivated by the realm of deep learning and its potential in interpreting natural signals such as language, image, and audio.
